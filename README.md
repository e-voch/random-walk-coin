A Python simulation that models flipping coins with customisable probabilities and  side values.
The program visualises how different types of coins affect a running balance over many flips.

Features:
Coin class with:
-  Customisable probability of landing on heads (p_heads)
-  Customisable values for heads & tails (default: +1 / −1)
-  Random walk simulation of a starting balance changing over time
-  Supports multiple coins at once (fair, biased, or custom)
-  Matplotlib graph comparing all coin simulations

How to run:
1.  Have all Python files in the same folder
2.  Install the matplotlib library (pip install matplotlib)
3.  Run the main file
